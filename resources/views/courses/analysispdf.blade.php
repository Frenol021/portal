                        This Handbook provides an introduction to basic procedures and methods of data
                        analysis. We provide a framework to guide program staff in their thinking about these
                        procedures and methods and their relevant applications in MSHS settings. Accordingly,
                        this Handbook was developed to support the work of MSHS staff across content areas.
                        This Handbook was created because “using data in meaningful ways” includes many
                        possibilities – and a great deal of information. Some of this information is complex and
                        highly dependent upon specialized knowledge. However, there are many ways of “using
                        data” that are more basic and that involve relatively simple procedures. Our purpose is to
                        provide MSHS programs with a basic framework for thinking about, working with, and
                        ultimately be nefiting from an increased ability to use data for program purposes.

                  <h3><b>Guiding Principles for Approaching Data Analysis</b></h3>
                  <p>
                        1. To provide information to program staff from a variety of different backgrounds and levels of prior experience.<br>
                        2. To create a “value-added” framework that presents strategies, concepts, procedures,methods
                        and techniques in the context of real-life examples.<br>
                        3. To appreciate that learning takes time.<br>
                        4. Comfort, confidence, and competence take practice.<br>
                        5. Data analysis provides opportunities to “reduce the burden.”
                   </p>
                   <h3><b>Why Do We Need Data Analysis?</b></h3>
                   <p>
                    Data is short hand for “information,” and whether you are collecting, reviewing, and/or analyzing data this process has always been part of Head Start program operations.
                    Children’s enrollment into the program requires many pieces of information. The provision of health and dental services includes information from screening and any
                    follow-up services that are provided. All areas of a Head Start program – content and
                    management – involve the collection and use of substantial amounts of information. For
                    MSHS programs, the use of data becomes even more crucial, as essential information
                    must be managed within relatively short program seasons. Very few people working in
                    MSHS programs complain about not having enough to do!

                <div class="accordion-body"><h3><b>Data is… </b></h3>
                <p>
                Taking from the above definitions, a practical approach to defining data is that data
                is numbers, characters, images, or other method of recording, in a form which can be
                assessed to make a determination or decision about a specific action. Many believe
                that data on its own has no meaning, only when interpreted does it take on meaning
                and become information. By closely examining data we can find patterns to perceive
                information, and then information can be used to enhance knowledge (The Free On-line
                Dictionary of Computing, 1993-2005 Denis Howe).
                One thing that Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs can do well is gather data.
                Using an upstream program as an example, in late May the data gathering process is swift
                and fast during enrollment. If the data relates to a child or family it is shared among
                appropriate Head Start staff. When the program ends, the data is stored, and next thing
                you know it is March and the program is preparing for pre-service. The question that
                one is always left with is: what do we do with all this data and or information? One of the
                goals of this handbook is to help you answer this question
                </p>

                <h3><b>Qualitative data</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Data that is represented either in a verbal or narrative format is qualitative data. These
                    types of data are collected through focus groups, interviews, opened ended questionnaire
                    items, and other less structured situations. A simple way to look at qualitative data is
                    to think of qualitative data in the form of words. Later on, we will explore how the
                    transcript below can be used as a source of data.
                </p>
                 <h3><b>Quantitative data</b></h3>
                 <p>
                    Quantitative data is data that is expressed in numerical terms, in which the
                    numeric values could be large or small. Numerical values may correspond to a specific category or label.

                </p>
                <h3><b>Data Strategies</b></h3>
                <p>
                    There are a variety of strategies for quantitative and qualitative analyses, many of which
                    go well beyond the scope of an introductory Handbook. Different strategies provide
                    data analysts with an organized approach to working with data; they enable the analyst
                    to create a “logical sequence” for the use of different procedures. In the boxes below,
                    we offer four examples of strategies for quantitative analysis that you may consider as
                    you work with and develop your skills in data analysis as well as reasons why you may
                    consider using the strategy. Some of these strategies are used in Section V when looking
                    at particular content area data.

                <h3><b>TThe “Problem” with Data Analysis</b></h3>
                <p>
            What does ‘data analysis’ mean? Does it refer to one method or many? A collection of
            different procedures? Is it a process? If so, what does that mean? More important, can
            MSHS program staff – without a background in math or statistics – learn to identify and
            use data analysis in their work? (P.S. - the answer to the last question is Yes! – assuming a
            minimum investment of time, effort, and practice).<br>
            Data analysis can refer to a variety of specific procedures and methods. However, before
            programs can effectively use these procedures and methods, we believe it is important to
            see data analysis as part of a process. By this, we mean that data analysis involves goals;
            relationships; decision making; and ideas, in addition to working with the actual data
            itself. Simply put, data analysis includes ways of working with information (data) to
            support the work, goals and plans of your program or agency..
                </p>
                <h3><b>Data Analysis as a Linear Process</b></h3>
                <p>
                A strictly linear approach to data analysis is to work through the components in order,
                from beginning to end. A possible advantage of this approach is that it is structured and
                organized, as the steps of the process are arranged in a fixed order. In addition, this linear
                conceptualization of the process may make it easier to learn. A possible disadvantage is
                that the step-by-step nature of the decision making may obscure or limit the power of the
                analyses – in other words, the structured nature of the process limits its effectiveness.
                </p>

                <h3><b>Data Analysis as a Cycle</b></h3>
                <p>
                    A cyclical approach to data analysis provides much more flexibility to the nature of
                    the decision making and also includes more and different kinds of decisions to be made.
                    In this approach, different components of the process can be worked on at different
                    times and in different sequences – as long as everything comes “together” at the end. A
                    possible advantage of this approach is that program staff are not “bound” to work on
                    each step in order. The potential exists for program staff to “learn by doing” and to make
                    improvements to the process before it is completed.

                <h3><b>Developing a Team</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Similar to the Community Assessment, in which the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start
                    Director has the responsibility of ensuring that the data analysis is fully completed and
                    implemented, we would suggest the same for the data analysis. Ultimately the Migrant
                    and Seasonal Head Start Director is responsible for assuring that the data be gathered
                    and analyzed, is ready to present to appropriate stakeholders, and ready to be used for
                    program decision making and enhancement.<br>
                    Although the director holds the final responsibility for the data analysis process and
                    products, other staff are active participants in the collection and analysis of data.
                    Programs may choose to use existing policy groups to implement the data analysis
                    process, or establish a separate data analysis team. The Policy Council and Board are
                    consulted regarding the plan for implementing the decisions ascertained from the data
                    analysis, and ultimately both groups review and approve all decisions that are made.
                    The data analysis process must be designed to include a variety of stakeholders.<br>
                    Stakeholders are individuals that have a vested interest in the Migrant and Seasonal
                    Head Start Program – they will benefit from the program in some way. Migrant and
                    Seasonal Head Start programs generally operate using a systems approach, which means
                    that there already exist several teams and committees made up of various levels of the
                    organization including staff, parents, Board and Policy Council and representatives from
                    the community. Various individuals can be identified to form a data analysis team and
                    select a team leader.
                </p>
                <h3><b>Planning</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Planning is a very integral part of the data analysis process. It is imperative that you
                    develop a plan to engage in data analysis. The plan should outline your data analysis
                    process and include the purpose, questions, data collection methods, needed resources,
                    identified lead person, as well as a timetable for completing all of the necessary tasks. The
                    reality within most programs is that individuals are always managing a variety of different
                    tasks at any given time. The actual process of data analysis should be given priority.
                    Allow time for the identified person to have time or the person’s supervisor can reassign
                    certain tasks so that they can devote the appropriate amount of time to the project.
                </p>
                <h3><b>Data Management</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Data comes from many places and a variety of formats. It is important to take a
                    systematic approach and think about the following questions:
                    •How will you keep track of all the data?<br>
                    •How will you make the data available to several members of your team?<br>
                    •How will you collect and integrate data over a period of time?<br>
                    •How can you set up the system so that others can step in if your job responsibilities change?
                </p>
                 <h3><b>Writing</b></h3>
                 <p>
                    Write your key findings and interpretations as related to your purpose. A well written
                    report ought to proceed from your findings and interpretations to recommendations
                    that are clear and concise. The report should include a brief narrative consisting
                    of a restatement of your purpose(s), question(s), finding(s), interpretation(s) and recommendation(s).
                 </p>
                   <h3><b>Evaluation</b></h3>
                   <p>
                    As identified in Section 3 Conceptualizing Data Analysis as a Process, the final step of
                    the Managing the Data Analysis Process is evaluation. Here, the data analysis team can
                    review and reflect upon:<br>
                    •Development of a team: was team structure and team make-up appropriate?<br>
                    •Planning: was the plan followed, timelines met?<br>
                    •Data Management: How well was the data stored? Did the appropriate people have access to data when needed? Was the appropriate computer software used, was it user
                    friendly and were you able to go about finding needed information?<br>
                    •Writing, Reporting: How well did the writing tell the story of the data? Did the
                    intended audience find the presentation of information effective? Was the report well written?

                  <p>
                    Working with data in real life situations always involves some combination of good news
                    and bad news (of course, not necessarily in equal amounts).
                    In Head Start programs, data is everywhere. Every enrollment form, developmental
                    history and child screening is a potential source of data, as are lesson plans, teachers’
                    observations of children and even the comments made by bus drivers. Likewise, every
                    pre-service evaluation form is also a source of data, as is every statement made by a
                    parent, whether or not it is written down.

                    most basic types are:<br>
                    •Summary Measures<br>

                   <p>
                    There are also a number of ways that qualitative data can be analyzed. We will concentrate
                    on a narrative analysis method using questionnaires and interviews.
                    Although the following examples are identified as narrative analysis the same process can
                    be used when analyzing interviews and questionnaires.
                   </p>
                   <h3><b>Type on a Path</b></h3>
                   <p>
                   You may have noticed that there are other tools associated with the type tool The third tool down isthe type on a path tool It does what the name implies
                    To use this tool, irst make a circle using the ellipse tool Now with the type on a path tool, move the cursor over the top of the circle until it has a wavy dot-
                    ted line through it Click and start typing You should see that the type starts where you clicked and fol-
                    lows the path of the circle You should also see that the circle itself is no longer visible—it is no longer a circle, but a circular path This makes sense, since if
                    you wanted type on a circle, you would want to make another circle somewhat smaller so the type did not sit directly on it

                Unlike Illustrator, Photoshop uses a bitmap description of an image. This method is great for what we call continuous tone images—images that do not contain lines
                and ills, but instead gradations of tone and color. Photographs are a good example of continuous tone images. Many tools and techniques in Photoshop are derived
                from concepts long used in traditional photography and darkroom techniques.Because Photoshop’s basic method of drawing is completely diferent from Illustrator’s, the tools work in very
                diferent ways. Fortunately, however, many techniques learned in Illustrator still apply.

                <h3><b>Pixels</b></h3>
                <p>
                  In your web browser, ind an image that you like Click and hold on it, then drag it to the desktop Now drag the icon for that image (the image ile) on the
                  desktop over the Photoshop icon to open it in Photoshop You could also open it in Photoshop by control-clicking the ile and choosing Photoshop
                  Exactly as you did in Illustrator, use the zoom tool to magnify the image many times You should see a couple of things First, the image is composed of
                  squares—these are called pixels Each pixel can be only one color (if they appear to contain more
                  than one color then it is an optical illusion called an adjacency efect) These pixels are the basic building blocks for an image, and all Photoshop (bitmap)images are composed entirely of these and nothing
                </p>
                <h3><b>New Document</b></h3>
                <p>
                  Close the image you have open in Photoshop and open a new document (File / New) Even though you will probably rarely open a blank image like this in-
                  stead of a photograph, a blank document will help us to see the basics of the application.
                  Unlike Illustrator, Photoshop has no page, only those little pixels that make up an image The more pixels there are in an image, the smaller they will look To
                  use an analogy presented earlier in this book, we need graph paper with very small squares (pixels),hence a lot of squares
                </p>
                <h3><b>Brush Tool & Options</b></h3>
                <p>
                Let’s treat Photoshop as a painting program for a little while Choose the irst brush tool (don't use the brush tool with the circle and arrow) Now look
                at the options panel, which is the horizontal ribbon over the top of the window Like Illustrator, this top ribbon changes according to the tool you have cho-
                sen, but unlike Illustrator, it is the only way to make some settings for the tool you have selected (in this case the paintbrush)
                Many of the options are the same for diferent tools,so let’s look at these in detail The most important options are in the second box on the left Clicking on
                this will give you a pop-up menu which allows you to change the size of your brush (let’s set it on 30 pixels), the hardness (or fuzziness) of your brush (set it
                somewhere near the middle), and the shape of your brush (leave it a circle)
                </p>

                Photoshop is a bottomless application. Because you can do multiple operations in sequence to get diferent effects, the true bounds of the program are as elusive as
                what one could do in a traditional photographic darkroom. In this chapter we will look at a few new things and look at others like layers in more depth.
                </p>
                <h3><b>The View & Filters</b></h3>
                <p>
                  Photoshop needs screen space Since we all don’t have multiple large monitors, we need to be able to maximize what we do have Pressing the ‘f’ key
                  cycles through diferent view modes to get rid of the clutter of the window frame so you can concentrate on what you are working on Combined with this is
                  the tab key, which toggles the panels on and of Now let's get some more screen space Go to the Window menu and select Application Frame to un-
                  check it This will put everything except your document to the edge of your screen, giving you more real estate
                  Now go to Preferences / Interface, and then uncheck 'Open Documents as Tabs' Tabs are wonderful ways of keeping documents in order, but in
                  Photoshop we often want to work with two images on the screen at once, so tabs are usually counter-productive If you make sure the option un-
                  der that (Enable Floating Document Window Docking) is checked you can still make two or more documents tabbed by dragging one document frame over
                  the other (until you get a blue frame), and release tabs by dragging the tab away from the document.
                </p>
                 <h3><b>Quick Mask & Saving Selections</b></h3>
                 <p>
                 As stated before, making selections is very important in Photoshop Here is another way of selecting that is very useful With an image open, make
                  a selection using any of the ways that we have covered Now click on the second to the last icon in the tool panel Your image should now have a
                  red overlay where it is not selected and no overlay where it is selected The red is called a mask and we are in the quick mask mode This mask is like a
                  paper mask you would use to block the paint when spray-painting.
                  Also notice that any colors you may have had in the tool panel’s color chips have now turned to black and white With the brush tool ‘paint out’ some of
                  the selection, exchange colors (little double arrow or the ‘x’ key – remember?) and ‘paint in’ some of the selection When you are inished, click again on the
                  quick mask tool to show the selection in marching ants again You will see your painting changed the selection With quick mask you can easily modify a selection to get it just right
                 </p>
                 <h3><b>Fill and Stroke</b></h3>
                 <p>
                 Some things that are obvious in Illustrator are not as obvious in Photoshop Lets make a rectangle the Photoshop way First drag out a selection in the
                shape of a rectangle Now go to Edit / Stroke The resulting box is where you make a stroke around your rectangle You have to experiment with how
                many pixels translates to what width of stroke It
