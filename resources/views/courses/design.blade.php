                    The Web is another very powerful communication mode of recent
                    origin. It has turned out to be an increasingly important resource of
                    encompassing all conceivable aspects of human life like business,
                    education, entertainment, governance, personal life, health and what not.
                    Web sites are hosted by anyone including individuals,
                    organisations, business enterprises, and voluntary organisations etc.
                    who have an interest in telling the world about themselves or about
                    their products/services.

                  <p>
                    Web site is a site or set of files stored on the World Wide Web.
                    It is viewed with a browser like Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox,
                    Safari or Netscape. Each Web site contains a home page (the main
                    page which users see when they enter the site) and additional
                    documents and files. The sites are owned and managed by individuals
                    or organisations or companies to promote their interests.
                    The pages of a Web site can usually be accessed from the
                    homepage or otherwise called Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The
                    browser (the user‘s application to access homepage)
                   </p>
                 <h3><b>Static and Dynamic Web Sites</b></h3>  
                 <p>
                 In static Web site the information is displayed in the same format
                    as they are stored in the server. Such information is primarily coded in
                    HTML (and the address ends in .htm). Most of the Web sites are static
                    as they present pre-defined, static information, in the sense the pages
                    retrieved by different users at different times remain the same. To
                    make a change to the content, the files need to be manually opened,
                    data changed and the new version should be uploading to the Web.<br>
                    Dynamic Web site pages are ones that retrieves fresh information
                    each time you view (like the latest news you see or various games you
                    play on the Web). How one retrieves examination at MPBOU site
                    may cited as an example. The ‗Examination Results‘ button at
                    www.bhojvirtual university.com/ can be described as dynamically
                    built because it supplies different information (marks) to different
                    students when the candidates search by entering their enroll numbers.
                    The information, in fact, doesn‘t come from html pages but from
                    databases (which may be updated minute by minute, day or week).
                 </p>
                 <h3><b>Where and How to host your Web Site</b></h3> 
                 <p>
                 Web hosting can be free or paid. There are many agencies
                (Internet Service Providers) that provide you with free hosting
                facility. The drawbacks of free hosting are that the traffic/visibility of
                the site could be poor as the natural search engines won‘t place/rank
                you well. Besides, the ISPs tend to place advertisements on your
                Web site to cover their expenses which may not be to your liking.
                Another alternative is to host the Web site on your own server.
                Organisations that have steady IT set-up resort to this. The third
                option is to share a multiple Web hosting package against payment
                (which is not much expensive now-a-days).[Multiple domain hosting
                packages can be viewed and selected from the Internet to choose the
                one that suits you).

                    Designing and creation of a Web page is like production of a book. It’s a
                    creative work, involving many a task like writing, maintenance of style,
                    designing, adding of pictures and graphs, and shaping up the appearance.
                    In the same line, the Web page offers scope for conveying and
                    communicating information using a variety of options including text,
                    graphics, photos, video, sound, animation, and link to other sites. In this
                    Unit, we shall, however, confine to discussion on composing and shaping of Web text.
                </p>

                <h3><b>Readers’ Approach to Online Pages</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Reading habit of Web users should be kept in mind while writing the
                    text. Before reading a book in full, a reader would have already made a
                    cursory look and determined to go ahead. However, the case of Web
                    reading is different. He is not sure whether any among the plethora of sites
                    he visits and documents therein will be relevant to his requirement.
                    Hence, he will not spend time going through every document in Web sites.
                    As a result, strategies have been evolved in quickly assessing the Web
                    sites as to whether the Web in question serves his purpose. If anyone is
                    found useful/relevant, he will settle down to read the item page by page.
                    We shall discuss in this section some of the strategies.
                </p>
                 <h3><b>Textual Elements of Web Page: Guidelines</b></h3>
                 <p>
                    It is an accepted fact that reading online takes more time than
                    otherwise. According to a study conducted by Jakob Nielsen of the Nielsen
                    Norman Group, reading a book on any electronic devices whether it’s
                    Kindle or iPad, takes longer time than reading the standard paper version
                    of the same book. Also one is not sure what he reads will be of use at the
                    end. Hence most online readers are compulsory scanners or skimmers who
                    skim Web pages rather than the read word-by-word. Even systematic
                    readers also would love to have special online reading structures in the text
                    so that they do not have to slow down picking their way through the pages.
                </p>

                <h3><b>Use of Passive Voice</b></h3>
                <p>
                In actual practice these three programs are used to-
                gether much of the time So a book like this will be
                done with InDesign, but the photographs (usually
                screen-shot images in this case) are done in Photo-
                shop and placed into InDesign, and the line illustra-
                tions like the circle a few pages back are made in
                Illustrator and likewise placed into InDesign
                </p>
                    Use of passive voice in Web writing provides an edge over active voice.
                    Passive voice directly represents action which enhances scanability. To
                    illustrate this point, take the example of M/s Godrej Company that
                    supplies library stacks. Let us frame the statement in the following ways:
                    ‘M/s Godrej supplies library stacks’ (active voice) and ‘Library stacks are
                    supplied by M/s Godrej’ (passive voice). You will notice that the latter
                    (passive voice) focuses on the library stacks and readers can arrive at
                    ‘library stacks’ (the library is interested in the stacks than the supplier)easily.

                    In this unit, we simplify the topic of Web graphics. In a perfect world, we‘d dedicate
                    pages and pages to the nuances of using graphics on the Web (mostly because we like
                    graphics), but then you‘d never get to the rest of the lessons. We also don‘t want you to feel
                    overwhelmed when it comes to using Web graphics. As you might have discovered, you can
                    easily find an overabundance of information about advanced graphics by looking on the
                    Internet and in bookstores everywhere.

                <h3><b>The Workspace</b></h3>
                <p>
                Like all the applications we will be working with, Illustrator uses diferent areas of the workspace for diferent things Go ahead and open Illustrator, then make a new document by going to File / New.
                At the very top of the screen is the menu bar Just like in any application, this is where the primary controls are Let’s use a menu item now to standardize the way your screen looks with the one used in this 
                book Go to Window / Workspace / Web (whenever you see this way of stating directions in this book it means you go to the menu bar at the very top of the screen) What this does is set up the ‘workspace’ for
                working on the web But we don’t actually want to do this, so go back to the window and go to Window /Workspace / Essentials Notice how all of the things on the screen change
                </p>
                <p>
                On the left of the screen is a ribbon of tools This is a loating panel, and you can drag it wherever you want by clicking and dragging (while holding down
                the mouse button) on the middle of the very top of it Also see what happens if you double-click on the top of it Drag the panel around and click on the x at
                the top right of the panel Oops, if you did it right, you just made the tools disappear Bring them back by going to Window / Tools (the eighth item in the
                menu) A check mark next to the menu item indicates it is showing on your screen If you really mess things up, or ever want to get to the default set of
                panels, just go to Window / Workspace / Reset Essentials
                </p>
                <p>
                The ribbon on the right side of the screen represents other panels These are individual boxes that govern how things work in the application To see their
                names, put your cursor on the left side border of the icon strip and drag to pull them out Click on a few to get an idea of how they work If you close any, or
                want to bring up more, go to Window menu again and see the list of panels you can work with Don’t let the shear number overwhelm you You don’t need
                to use all of them, especially now Panels can be nested within each other, they can be collapsed or expanded, and they can connect with each other by
                stacking But don’t worry to much about that until later when you want to have everything you are using most very handy
                </p>
                <h3><b>A New Document</b></h3>
                <p>
                Close the window you were working on and let's learn more about a document Go to New / Document, and take a quick look at the requester box that
                shows up Make sure you have a letter-sized sheet selected and the units are in a measurement system you are familiar with You will probably want touse inches

            <div id="flush-collapseFour" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingFour"

                <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>
                    The first publicly available description of Hypertext Markup Language was a document
                    called HTML Tags, first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes
                    20 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. HTML is a text and
                    image formatting language used by web browsers to dynamically format web pages. Many of
                    the text elements are found in the 1988 and Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an
                    application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force
                    (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification,
                    "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)". Further development under the auspices of the IETF
                    was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been
                    maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web
                    Consortium (W3C). However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard
                    (ISO/IEC 15445:2000).
                </p>
                <h3><b>DYNAMIC HTML</b></h3>
                <p>
                    The Dynamic HTML is a collective term for a combination of new Hypertext Markup
                    Language (HTML) tags and options that will let you create web pages more animated and
                    more responsive to user interaction than previous versions of HTML. Much of dynamic
                    HTML is specified in HTML 4.0. Simple examples of dynamic HTML pages would include
                    (1) having the color of a text heading change when a user passes a mouse over it or (2)
                    allowing a user to ―drag and drop‖ an image to another place on a web page. Dynamic HTML
                    can allow web documents to look and act like desktop applications or multimedia
                    productions.
                </p>
                <h3><b>FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP)</b></h3>
                <p>
                    FTP is a standard Internet protocol. It is the simplest way to exchange files between
                    computers on the Internet. Like the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which transfers
                    displayable web pages and related files, and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP),
                    which transfers e-mail, FTP is an application protocol that uses the Internet's TCP/IP
                    protocols. FTP is commonly used to transfer web page files from their creator to the
                    computer that acts as their server for everyone on the Internet. It‘s also commonly used to
                    download programmes and other files to your computer from other servers.
                </p>
                 <h3><b>SUMMARY</b></h3>
                 <p>
                    The libraries and information centres can develop and design their own Web pages and host
                    them on the Internet to gain visibility as well as provide access to their local OPAC.
                    Technologies like HTML, DHTML, and XML help in creating and designing Web pages.
                    Uniform Resource Locator, know by a variety of similar names are techniques for
                    establishing Internet address where files and other resources can be located. A through
                    understanding of the different URLs and their proper use is essential for good Web design. It
                    is necessary one should know at least basic HTML tags to put the information on Internet.
                    Though HTML has certain problems associated with it for example, inability to handle
                    efficient search, but still it is widely used for web page design.

                    basically because the Internet has not been around that long and it is only in the past
                    decade that the Internet has exploded and become part of people's everyday lives. So,
                    website design is still new in the grand scheme of things, but it has certainly
                    undergone many changes over the years.

                  <h3><b>Two Ways to Make Type</b></h3>
                  <p>
                  Make sure that the bounding box is on by going to View/Show Bounding Box (if it reads Hide Bounding Box, do not select it) Now with the selection tool drag the corners of the completed type box (type
                  area in Illustrator terminology) around The type will move and reformat according to the dimensions of the box This way of entering text into Illustrator is
                  called area type It is the best way to enter text that will need to low within the type area We call longer sections of type and paragraphs body or paragraph copy If the type extends past the text
                  area you will get a small red box with a ‘+’ in it which signiies that the box has more text than is shown
                  </p>
                   <h3><b>Character Panel</b></h3>
                   <p>
                   The paragraph panel is most useful with area text  (although you should see what it does using it with point type) With a text box or a paragraph(s) selected, change the justiication of your paragraphs
                   by clicking on one of the irst four boxes at the top of the panel Don't use the last three boxes—these are for very special uses
                   The irst will make your text left justiied or aligned only on the left This is the most common way to format text, and the main one used in formatting
                  this book The second box centers your type This makes the text very diicult to read, but every once in a while it is suitable for short bits of text like song lyrics The third box is right justiied
                   </p>
                   <h3><b>Type on a Path</b></h3>
                   <p>
                   You may have noticed that there are other tools associated with the type tool The third tool down isthe type on a path tool It does what the name implies
                    To use this tool, irst make a circle using the ellipse tool Now with the type on a path tool, move the cursor over the top of the circle until it has a wavy dot-
                    ted line through it Click and start typing You should see that the type starts where you clicked and fol-
                    lows the path of the circle You should also see that the circle itself is no longer visible—it is no longer a circle, but a circular path This makes sense, since if
                    you wanted type on a circle, you would want to make another circle somewhat smaller so the type did not sit directly on it
                   </p>

                Unlike Illustrator, Photoshop uses a bitmap description of an image. This method is great for what we call continuous tone images—images that do not contain lines
                and ills, but instead gradations of tone and color. Photographs are a good example of continuous tone images. Many tools and techniques in Photoshop are derived
                from concepts long used in traditional photography and darkroom techniques.Because Photoshop’s basic method of drawing is completely diferent from Illustrator’s, the tools work in very
                diferent ways. Fortunately, however, many techniques learned in Illustrator still apply.
                </p>
                <h3><b>Pixels</b></h3>
                <p>
                  In your web browser, ind an image that you like Click and hold on it, then drag it to the desktop Now drag the icon for that image (the image ile) on the
                  desktop over the Photoshop icon to open it in Photoshop You could also open it in Photoshop by control-clicking the ile and choosing Photoshop
                  Exactly as you did in Illustrator, use the zoom tool to magnify the image many times You should see a couple of things First, the image is composed of
                  squares—these are called pixels Each pixel can be only one color (if they appear to contain more
                  than one color then it is an optical illusion called an adjacency efect) These pixels are the basic building blocks for an image, and all Photoshop (bitmap)images are composed entirely of these and nothing
                </p>
                <h3><b>New Document</b></h3>
                <p>
                  Close the image you have open in Photoshop and open a new document (File / New) Even though you will probably rarely open a blank image like this in-
                  stead of a photograph, a blank document will help us to see the basics of the application.
                  Unlike Illustrator, Photoshop has no page, only those little pixels that make up an image The more pixels there are in an image, the smaller they will look To
                  use an analogy presented earlier in this book, we need graph paper with very small squares (pixels),hence a lot of squares
                </p>
                <h3><b>Brush Tool & Options</b></h3>
                <p>
                Let’s treat Photoshop as a painting program for a little while Choose the irst brush tool (don't use the brush tool with the circle and arrow) Now look
                at the options panel, which is the horizontal ribbon over the top of the window Like Illustrator, this top ribbon changes according to the tool you have cho-
                sen, but unlike Illustrator, it is the only way to make some settings for the tool you have selected (in this case the paintbrush)
                Many of the options are the same for diferent tools,so let’s look at these in detail The most important options are in the second box on the left Clicking on
                this will give you a pop-up menu which allows you to change the size of your brush (let’s set it on 30 pixels), the hardness (or fuzziness) of your brush (set it
                somewhere near the middle), and the shape of your brush (leave it a circle)
                </p>

                Photoshop is a bottomless application. Because you can do multiple operations in sequence to get diferent effects, the true bounds of the program are as elusive as
                what one could do in a traditional photographic darkroom. In this chapter we will look at a few new things and look at others like layers in more depth.
                </p>
                <h3><b>The View & Filters</b></h3>
                <p>
                  Photoshop needs screen space Since we all don’t have multiple large monitors, we need to be able to maximize what we do have Pressing the ‘f’ key
                  cycles through diferent view modes to get rid of the clutter of the window frame so you can concentrate on what you are working on Combined with this is
                  the tab key, which toggles the panels on and of Now let's get some more screen space Go to the Window menu and select Application Frame to un-
                  check it This will put everything except your document to the edge of your screen, giving you more real estate
                  Now go to Preferences / Interface, and then uncheck 'Open Documents as Tabs' Tabs are wonderful ways of keeping documents in order, but in
                  Photoshop we often want to work with two images on the screen at once, so tabs are usually counter-productive If you make sure the option un-
                  der that (Enable Floating Document Window Docking) is checked you can still make two or more documents tabbed by dragging one document frame over
                  the other (until you get a blue frame), and release tabs by dragging the tab away from the document.
                </p>
                 <h3><b>Quick Mask & Saving Selections</b></h3>
                 <p>
                 As stated before, making selections is very important in Photoshop Here is another way of selecting that is very useful With an image open, make
                  a selection using any of the ways that we have covered Now click on the second to the last icon in the tool panel Your image should now have a
                  red overlay where it is not selected and no overlay where it is selected The red is called a mask and we are in the quick mask mode This mask is like a
                  paper mask you would use to block the paint when spray-painting.
                  Also notice that any colors you may have had in the tool panel’s color chips have now turned to black and white With the brush tool ‘paint out’ some of
                  the selection, exchange colors (little double arrow or the ‘x’ key – remember?) and ‘paint in’ some of the selection When you are inished, click again on the
                  quick mask tool to show the selection in marching ants again You will see your painting changed the selection With quick mask you can easily modify a selection to get it just right
                 </p>
                 <h3><b>Fill and Stroke</b></h3>
                 <p>
                 Some things that are obvious in Illustrator are not as obvious in Photoshop Lets make a rectangle the Photoshop way First drag out a selection in the
                shape of a rectangle Now go to Edit / Stroke The resulting box is where you make a stroke around your rectangle You have to experiment with how
                many pixels translates to what width of stroke It

                  Almost every well-designed advertisement, poster, lier(etcetera) is designed in Illustrator. But also, the majority of these use photographs or other illustrations done
                  in Photoshop. The real power of using these applications is using them together. In this chapter we will see how to correctly place Photoshop iles into your Illustrator designs.
                  Image sizing theory is a very important part of this chapter, but don’t worry if you just cannot understand it—there are step by step instructions to sizing images after the explanation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Before we place Photoshop images into Illustrator we must size them for print, since often times we want to print the document Sizing images for print
                  is one of the most diicult concepts to master, but is extremely important if you want high-quality images And you do Open any photograph in Photoshop and go to Im-
                  age / Image Size When we consider images for the screen, the size of pixels will always correspond to the ‘pixels’ on the screen, so we are only concerned with the number of pixels
                  </p>
                   <h3><b>Sizing Images Theory</b></h3>
                  <p>
                  For printing, if the pixels are too large (another way of saying not enough pixels for the size of the image), then they will be seen by the naked eye, and
                  the image will look bad So we want to make sure those pixels are small enough Adjusting the image size in inches (or another dimension which is not pixels) is how we do that
                  </p>
                  <h3><b>Sizing Images in Use</b></h3>
                  <p>
                  The previous section hopefully gave you some in-sight into how image sizing works But, it is a diicult subject for most people, so on the next few pages
                  are some steps you should follow (exactly!) to make sure your images are sized correctly Also included is a review of sizing images for the screen, and you will
                  see that sizing images for InDesign is the same, so it is included also Finally, although you probably won’t need it, the related subject of sizing to copy and
                  paste in Photoshop is also included You might want to bookmark these instructions They are repeated as reference at the end of this book

                  Whenever you need to design communication that spans multiple pages, InDesign is the application to use. InDesign also excels in automatic typography controls,
                  so if your design contains a lot of body copy (like a resume), you should use it instead of Illustrator. InDesign excels at documents as short as newsletter or tri-folds
                  and as long as magazines and books. Although some Illustration can also be done in InDesign (as many of the illustrations in this book were), InDesign can get you
                  into trouble quickly if you rely on it too much for this. Some designers even use InDesign almost exclusively. If you do not need the design lexibility of Illustrator nor
                  the illustration capability this approach makes sense.
